# Solid Simulation Tutorials

A curated collection of Python examples focused on optimization-based solid simulation with guarantees on algorithmic convergence, penetration-free and inversion-free conditions. The examples are designed for ease of readability and understanding.

Introductory sections (with * following the titles) for each of the examples in this repository can be found in the free online book [Physics-based Simulation](https://phys-sim-book.github.io/).
